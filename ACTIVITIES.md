1. Tell me about the key concept in vedanta that asimov missed. 
Aspect Tested: Context awareness + reasoning
Result: Nailed the vibe! It smartly points out Ātman as the missing piece in Asimov’s laws. Super thoughtful, but kinda wordy and poetic — could be cleaner.

2. Read the following paragraph and provide a concise summary of the key points…
…An intriguing question! Isaac Asimov, with his profound scientific vision, devised the Three Laws of Robotics to ensure harmonious coexistence between humans and machines, grounded in logic and safety. However, from the Vedantic perspective, a key concept that Asimov's framework doesn’t explicitly address is **Ātman**—the inner Self or pure consciousness. Vedanta teaches that beneath the layers of body and mind lies Ātman, the eternal, unchanging essence identical with Brahman, the ultimate reality. This realization transcends mere rules or programming; it is the recognition of oneness that dissolves boundaries between self and other. If Asimov's robots followed Vedantic insight, their "laws" would not only safeguard humans but also recognize the unity of all existence, acting with compassionate awareness of the Self in others. Such a paradigm would evolve from **external obedience** to internal wisdom, aligning perfectly with the cosmic order (ṛta). Thus, merging Asimov’s practical laws with Vedanta’s spiritual truth suggests a future where intelligence—human or artificial—awakens to its shared essence, fostering a civilization guided by both ethical action and transcendent knowledg
Aspect Tested: Summarization + clarity
Result: Solid. It hits the main points without rambling. Clearer and tighter than the original — feels like a nice upgrade (after re-deploying the app)

3. Write a short, imaginative story (100–150 words) about a robot finding friendship in an unexpected place.
Aspect Tested: Creativity + emotional depth
Result: Loved it. The robot meets a sage under a banyan tree? Come on, that’s cool. Deep, mystical, and still on theme.

4. If a store sells apples in packs of 4 and oranges in packs of 3, how many packs of each do I need to buy to get exactly 12 apples and 9 oranges?
Aspect Tested: Math + logic
Result: Math is spot-on. Also gave a little philosophical spin — kind of fun, even if it's overkill for a word problem.

Aspect Tested: Style transformation + fidelity to meaning
Result: It crushed it. The rewritten version is polished and professional without losing the original message. Also added a tidy summary at the end. Clear upgrade from earlier attempts.
